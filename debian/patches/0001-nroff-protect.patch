Subject: nroff protect

Protect .dwdiffrc at the beginning of a line in man/dwdiff.1, which is
otherwise interpreted as an nroff macro, which is undefined, and the
line is discarded.  Instead of just shielding it, we boldface the
entire filename, like other literal strings (options and such) in the
man page.
