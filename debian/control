Description: diff program that operates word by word
 dwdiff is a diff program that operates at the word level
 instead of the line level. It is different from wdiff in that it allows the
 user to specify what should be considered whitespace, and in that it takes an
 optional list of characters that should be considered delimiters. Delimiters
 are single characters that are treated as if they are words, even when there
 is no whitespace separating them from preceding words or delimiters. dwdiff
 is mostly commandline compatible with wdiff. Only the --autopager, --terminal
 and --avoid-wraps options are not supported.
 .
 The default output from dwdiff is the new text, with the deleted and inserted
 parts annotated with markers. Command line options are available to change
 both what is printed, and the markers.
