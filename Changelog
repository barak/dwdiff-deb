Version 1.4:
    New features:
    - an option to use all punctuation characters as delimiters
    - Unicode (UTF-8) support including formatting insensitive comparison
    - case-insensitive comparison when the underlying diff program does not
      support it

Version 1.3:
    New features:
    - an option to print the line numbers at which the text appears in the old
      and new file respectively
    - an option to print only a user specified number of context lines
      surrounding lines with changes

    Bug fixes:
    - added printing of color mark-up codes at the start of every new line to
      improve viewing the output with less
    - the check for overlap between the delimiter and the whitespace sets was
      incomplete and incorrect
    - an inverted condition caused incorrect output if the newline character
      was not part of the whitespace set

Version 1.2.1:
    Bug fixes:
    - fixed a bug in color mode where the resetting of a color would cause
      extra characters to be printed

Version 1.2:
    New features:
    - color mode, enabled by -c
    - internationalisation. dwdiff can now use gettext and includes translated
      manual pages. Languages included in the distribution are: en (default)
      and nl.

Version 1.1:
    Bug fixes:
    - fixes bug in \x-escape expansion of whitespace and delimiter lists

    New features:
    - will work on POSIX compatible diff, i.e. diff without -a and -i options
    - handles empty whitespace specification
    - allows nul character in whitespace and delimiter specification
    - \-escape expansion of start/stop-delete/insert markers
    - a single dash (-) can be specified as a file to read from standard input
    - a double dash (--) will stop dwdiff from interpreting arguments starting
      with a dash as options
    - allows the user to specify further options to the diff program to allow
      minimal diffs, half-hearted algorithms etc.
